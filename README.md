#### **_Description_**
This is a full-stack application, making use of Django on the backend, React on the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database. This app is a playful spin on hypochondria, since as someone afflicted with this condition, it never hurts to make light of it occasionally! This app will humorously provide you either the "good news" or the "bad news" when a user inputs their medical symptoms to provide more realistic diagnosis (for the "good news") and less realistic diagnosis for the "bad news" (more of a hypochondriac viewpoint).
